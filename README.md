Recipe 3: Static Pages | Ruby on Rails

Overview:
Recipe 3 starts to get the user involved in Rails development. We begin developing the structure of a website that
we will be utilizing for future recipes. The recipe has the user leverage a basic template provided by bootstrap and
then we will work to wire up the various pages where we can serve some general pages that most websites contain.

Recipe includes:
 - install bootstrap3 (css file only). Future: replace with boostrap-sass once compliant with bootstrap3
 - generate ExternalPages controller (index, contact, about)
 - modify routes.rb
 - build initial set of tests
 - update views with initial HTML
 - deduplicate: build partials (header & footer)
 - update application.html.erb, de-duplicate title & description
